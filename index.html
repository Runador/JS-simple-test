          <h2>What is Java?</h2>
          <p>
            Java is a
            <a href="#" data-text="In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with strong abstraction from the 
            details of the computer. In contrast to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may 
            automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a 
            program simpler and more understandable than when using a lower-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how 
            high-level a programming language is." class="info-modal"> high-level, </a>
            <a href="#" data-text="Class-based programming, or more commonly class-orientation, is a style of object-oriented programming (OOP) 
            in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone 
            (compare prototype-based programming)." class="info-modal">class-based</a>
            <a href="#" data-text="Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &quotobjects&quot, which can contain 
            data and code. The data is in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and the code is in the form of procedures 
            (often known as methods)." class="info-modal">object-oriented</a>
            programming language that is designed 
            to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming 
            language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled 
            Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications
            are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the 
            underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, 
            but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime 
            code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular 
            programming languages in use according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>, particularly for clientâ€“server web 
            applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Java was originally developed by <b>James Gosling</b> at <a href="#" data-text="Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Sun for short) was an American 
            technology company that sold computers, computer components, software, and information technology services and created the Java 
            programming language, the Solaris operating system, ZFS, the Network File System (NFS), and SPARC microprocessors. Sun contributed 
            significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and 
            virtualized computing. Notable Sun acquisitions include Cray Business Systems Division, Storagetek, and Innotek GmbH, creators of 
            VirtualBox. Sun was founded on February 24, 1982. At its height, the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon 
            Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center." class="info-modal">Sun Microsystems</a>. 
            It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java 
            compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, 
            in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the 
            GPL-2.0-only license.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference 
            implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default 
            JVM for almost all Linux distributions. As of March 2023, Java 20 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current 
            long-term support (LTS) versions.

          <h2>Principles</h2>
          <p>
            There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
            <ol>
              <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
              <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
              <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
              <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
              <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
              <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h2>Special classes</h2>
          <ul>          
            <li>
              <strong>Applet</strong> 
              <p>Java applets were programs that were embedded in other applications, 
              typically in a Web page displayed in a web browser. The Java applet API is now deprecated since Java 9 in 2017.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Servlet</strong>
              <p>Java servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server 
                and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses to requests from 
                clients. Most of the time, this means generating HTML pages in response to HTTP requests, although there are a number of other 
                standard servlet classes available, for example for WebSocket communication.
              </p>
              <p>The Java servlet API has to some extent been superseded (but still used under the hood) by two standard Java technologies for web services:
              </p>
              <ul>          
                <li>the Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and</li>
                <li>the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Typical implementations of these APIs on Application Servers or Servlet Containers use a standard servlet for handling all
                 interactions with the HTTP requests and responses that delegate to the web service methods for the actual business logic.
              </p>  
            <li>
              <strong>JavaServer Pages</strong>
              <p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients.
                JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters <% and %>. A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application 
                in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Swing application</strong>
              <p>Swing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the 
                pluggable look and feel system of Swing. Clones of Windows, GTK+, and Motif are supplied by Sun. Apple also provides an Aqua look and 
                feel for macOS. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses 
                this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>JavaFX application</strong>
              <p>JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich web applications that can run across 
                a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI library for Java SE, but since JDK 11 JavaFX has not 
                been in the core JDK and instead in a separate module. JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows, 
                Linux, and macOS. JavaFX does not have support for native OS look and feels.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generics</strong>
              <p>In 2004, generics were added to the Java language, as part of J2SE 5.0. Prior to the introduction of generics, each variable 
                declaration had to be of a specific type. For container classes, for example, this is a problem because there is no easy way to 
                create a container that accepts only specific types of objects. Either the container operates on all subtypes of a class or interface, 
                usually Object, or a different container class has to be created for each contained class. Generics allow compile-time type checking 
                without having to create many container classes, each containing almost identical code. In addition to enabling more efficient code, 
                certain runtime exceptions are prevented from occurring, by issuing compile-time errors. If Java prevented all runtime type errors 
                (ClassCastExceptions) from occurring, it would be type safe.
              </p>
              <p>In 2016, the type system of Java was proven unsound in that it is possible to use generics to construct classes and methods that 
                allow assignment of an instance one class to a variable of another unrelated class. Such code is accepted by the compiler, but fails 
                at run time with a class cast exception.
              </p>

        <p>Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for 
          the Java programming language and for contributions to window systems.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Career & contributions</h2>
        <p>
          Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, 
          which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window, because Sun did not give it an open source license.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is known as the father of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java programming language</a>. He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software 
          from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java 
          programming language in 1994. He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a>. Gosling traces the origins of the approach to his early graduate student days, when he created a p-code virtual machine for the 
          lab's DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run programs written in UCSD Pascal. In the work leading to Java at Sun, he saw that 
          architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by implementing a similar philosophy: always program for 
          the same virtual machine. Another contribution of Gosling's was co-writing the "bundle" program, known as "shar", a utility thoroughly 
          detailed in Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike's book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unix_Programming_Environment">The Unix Programming Environment</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          He left Sun Microsystems on April 2, 2010, after it was acquired by the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>, citing reductions in pay, status, 
          and decision-making ability, along with change of role and ethical challenges. He has since taken a very critical stance towards Oracle 
          in interviews, noting that "during the integration meetings between Sun and Oracle, where we were being grilled about the patent situation 
          between Sun and Google, we could see the Oracle lawyer's eyes sparkle." He clarified his position during the 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.">Oracle v. Google</a> trial over 
          Android: "While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun. We were all really disturbed, 
          even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz">Jonathan Schwartz</a>: he just decided to put on a happy face and tried to turn lemons into lemonade, which annoyed a lot of folks 
          at Sun." However, he approved of the court's ruling that APIs should not be copyrightable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2011, Gosling joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>. Six months later, he followed his colleague Bill Vass and joined a startup called 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_Robotics">Liquid Robotics</a>. In late 2016, Liquid Robotics was acquired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing">Boeing</a>. 
          Following the acquisition, Gosling left Liquid Robotics to work at Amazon Web Services as Distinguished Engineer in May 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          He is an advisor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> company Lightbend, 
          Independent Director at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelastic">Jelastic</a>, and Strategic Advisor for 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_(software)">Eucalyptus</a>, and is a board member of DIRTT Environmental Solutions.
